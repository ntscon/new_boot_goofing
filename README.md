# new_boot_goofing

Scrapes https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/hospital-status-data and creates .png  with charts from DC hospital data.

Designed as a weekend project in Jan 22, based around an attempt to do a lot with few lines of code.  

Opportunites for further improvement:
name: __main__ coding standard
scrub % from variables
optional begin, end date args for dc_data_viz() function
